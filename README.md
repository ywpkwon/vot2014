# VOT 2014: Car Exercise

### Youngwook Paul Kwon, UC Berkeley

## Introduction

It was more fun than I expected and many things to think about. The input images of a moving vehicle are from the 2014 Visual Object Tracking Challenge (http://www.votchallenge.net/vot2014/).  I tried to answer the original and the most obvious question: "where is the vehicle given its location in the first frame?." I will also discuss about "what is the pixel-level segmentation of the car in each frame?."

## Report
